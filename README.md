## Overview

cub3D is inspired by the early era of 3D games such as *Wolfenstein 3D*.  
It uses **raycasting** to project a 2D map into a pseudo-3D environment and provides an immersive first-person view inside a maze-like structure.

The project relies on the **MLX42** graphics library to handle rendering, input, and window management.

## ‚ú® Features

### ‚úÖ Mandatory Part
- Raycasting engine rendering walls in pseudo-3D
- Textured walls
- Map parsing with full format validation
- Smooth player movement & rotation
- Collision detection
- Mouse toggle (optional)
- Ceiling and floor coloring
- Clean exit and resource management

### üåü Bonus Features (Beyond Requirements)
- üó∫Ô∏è **Minimap**: Displays the player's current position and orientation
- üó∫Ô∏è **Big Map (Q Key)**: Expands a large, detailed map and *pauses player movement* while it's open
- üî• **Lighter Animation**: A hand toggles a lighter. When lit, the world is bright; when off, it darkens
- üö™ **Interactive Doors**: Doors open when you step into them
- üñ±Ô∏è **Mouse Control (M Key)**: Toggle mouse input to turn the player's view

---

## Game Controls

Here are the controls you can use to navigate and interact with the game:

- **W**: Move forward
- **S**: Move backward
- **A**: Move left
- **D**: Move right
- **Left Arrow**: Turn left
- **Right Arrow**: Turn right
- **L**: Turn the light on and off (when turned on, the world becomes brighter)
- You can also click on the lighter icon in the window to toggle the light.
- **M**: Toggle using mouse instead of arrow keys (enables/disables mouse control for turning).
- **Q**: Toggle showing the big map.
- You can also click on the minimap in the window to show the large map.
- You can move around the large map using arrows.
- **Esc** or closing the window: Exit the game and close the window.

## Map Format (.cub file)

A valid `.cub` file includes:

1. **Texture paths for walls**
   - NO ./textures/wall_north.xpm  
   - SO ./textures/wall_south.xpm  
   - WE ./textures/wall_west.xpm  
   - EA ./textures/wall_east.xpm  

2. **RGB values for floor and ceiling**
   - F 220,100,0  
   - C 225,30,0  

3. **2D map layout** (must be closed/surrounded by walls)

   Example:
  ```text
    111111111
  1110001001011
  100000100001
   1101000001
     1 11111
```

## How to Build

### For macOS

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   First, you need to have the required dependencies installed. On macOS, you can use **Homebrew** to install the necessary packages.

   ```bash
   # Install Homebrew (if not already installed)
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

   # Install dependencies
   brew install cmake glfw
   ```
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the cub3D project repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:AghlaAbdo/42_Cub3D.git
    cd 42_Cub3D
    ```

3. **Build the Project**: The `Makefile` is set up to compile the project. Simply run the following command to build the project:

   ```bash
   make
   # For bonus part
   make bonus
   ```
   This will compile the program and generate the executable (`cub3D` or `cub3D_bonus` for the bonus version). For macOS, the compilation uses the following command:
   ```bash
   $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $^ -o $@ $(MLX) -lglfw -L"/Users/$(USER)/.brew/opt/glfw/lib/" $(LIBFT)
   ```

4. **Run the Program**: After successfully building the project, you can run the cub3D program with:

    ```bash
    ./cub3D path_to_map.cub
    # For bonus part
    ./cub3D_bonus path_to_map.cub
    ```
    Replace `path_to_map.cub` with the path to your `.cub` map file.

### For Linux

1. **Install Dependencies**: On Linux, you need to install CMake and GLFW for the project to work properly. You can use your package manager to install these dependencies.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install cmake libglfw3-dev
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the cub3D project repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:AghlaAbdo/42_Cub3D.git
    cd 42_Cub3D
    ```

3. **Build the Project**: The `Makefile` is set up to compile the project. Simply run the following command to build the project:

   ```bash
   make
   # For bonus part
   make bonus
   ```
   This will build the cub3D executable. For Linux, the compilation uses the following command:
   ```bash
   $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $^ -o $@ $(MLX) -lglfw -ldl -lm -lX11 -lpthread -lXrandr -lXi $(LIBFT)
   ```

4. **Run the Program**: After successfully building the project, you can run the cub3D program with:

    ```bash
    ./cub3D path_to_map.cub
    # For bonus part
    ./cub3D_bonus path_to_map.cub
    ```
    Replace `path_to_map.cub` with the path to your `.cub` map file.
